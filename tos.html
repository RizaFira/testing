    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of the Artchain web application and related services (the "Service") provided by the developer ("we", "us"). By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>2. Using the Service</h2>
    <p>The Service enables automated posting of user-generated videos to social platforms through API integrations. You represent and warrant that you own or have the necessary rights to any content you upload and that the content complies with applicable laws and third-party terms of service.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>3. Accounts and Access</h2>
    <p>Certain features may require you to authenticate with third-party services (for example, TikTok, Instagram, YouTube). By connecting an account you authorize the Service to act on your behalf according to the permissions you grant. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any credentials and for all actions taken through your accounts.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>4. Acceptable Use</h2>
    <p>You agree not to use the Service for unlawful purposes, to upload infringing or hateful content, or to violate any third-party terms of service. We reserve the right to suspend or terminate access that violates these Terms or our acceptable use standards.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The Service integrates with third-party APIs which are governed by their own terms and policies. We are not responsible for third-party services, and you must ensure compliance with those providers' terms.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>6. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, we will not be liable for indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages arising from your use of the Service. Our aggregate liability for direct damages will not exceed the amount you paid us in the prior 12 months (if any), or $100 if you have not paid us.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>7. No Warranty</h2>
    <p>The Service is provided "as is" and "as available" without warranties of any kind. We do not guarantee uptime, availability, or that the Service will meet your requirements.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>8. Termination</h2>
    <p>We may suspend or terminate access to the Service at any time, with or without cause. Upon termination, any rights granted to you under these Terms will immediately cease.</p>
